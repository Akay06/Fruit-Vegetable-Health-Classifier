# 🍏🍅 Fruit and Vegetable Classification App

This project is an image classification application that identifies whether an uploaded image is a fruit or vegetable, determines its type, and classifies it as fresh or rotten.

It is built using FastAPI as the backend and leverages four different models based on YOLO and TensorFlow to enhance classification accuracy. The frontend is developed using React, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ Multi-Model Classification – Uses multiple models for better accuracy.  
✔️ Fruit & Vegetable Detection – Identifies whether the image contains a fruit or vegetable.  
✔️ Type Recognition – Determines the specific fruit/vegetable type.  
✔️ Freshness Classification – Classifies the item as fresh or rotten.  
✔️ FastAPI Backend – A high-performance Python backend for real-time inference.  
✔️ React Frontend – A modern and interactive web interface.  

## 📌 Tech Stack  

### Backend (FastAPI)  
FastAPI – High-performance API framework  
YOLOv8 – Object detection model  
TensorFlow – Deep learning framework  

### Frontend (React)  
React.js – Modern frontend library  
Axios – API requests  

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Node.js (for frontend, optional)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1️⃣ **Backend (FastAPI)**
```bash
cd App/backend  
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python FruitVegetableClassification.py
```

## 🌐 Access the App  

Once the backend is running, open your browser and visit:
